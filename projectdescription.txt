Current Projects:

volunteer Manager App

I worked with after-school K-12 programs in San Francisco and Oakland as an undergrad, while also interacting with different groups on campus. One potentially troublesome thing that occurred everyday was tracking attendance, especially for those who were participating for credit over the course of the semester. The idea behind the Volunteer Manager is to have an easy way to track attendance in addition to other aspects of the daily schedule, such as organizing transportation to and from volunteer sites. Furthermore, organizations will have the flexibility of shaping the app to meet their specific needs, such as if volunteers are required to fill out progress sheets for one-on-one tutoring.

Past Projects: 

Master's Practicum: IoT Infant Monitor

Our group wanted to add an extra level of connectivity to commercially-available baby monitors, specifically for addressing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and alerting to parents when breathing has stopped. After interviewing parents, one issue that came up was the abrupt nature of monitor alarms that might occur for false readings. We wanted to utilize mobile technology to enable the parent to receive alerts, for example, even if the parent were outside in the yard while the baby was napping indoors. We produced a prototype that sent SMS text alerts to parents' phones when detected breathing dropped for about 20 seconds. If a parent wanted to see their child's breathing rate in real-time, I created a simple webpage integrated with Plotly that graphed our physical sensor data. Ideally, a single, fully developed app would be responsible for receiving alerts and displaying breathing data, but our time constraints limited us to separate native SMS and web page data display.
